**[Update]**: I have moved the slides to my presentation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bk0U76Yd73LGSCz6DgD1447Ib1xWCiWv/view?usp=sharing).

On March 1st, we decided to share with the data science community in Copenhagen some of the cool projects we work on at Adform. So I helped organize the second edition of the [Machine Learning and Beer](http://www.meetup.com/datacph/events/228706239/) event at our office and welcomed around 60 machine learning enthusiasts . The meetup turned out great and the positive feedback we got from the participants made it all worthwhile. Nice to see the small Copenhagen DS community growing and becoming more sophisticated with more and more companies making machine learning part of their roadmaps.

You can check out the [event photos](http://www.meetup.com/datacph/photos/), but you need to be a group member in order to see them.
